1.5.2 (2019-01-28)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#205 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/205>`_ from xiesc/master
  support for 64E-S3
* add an example yaml file for S3
* Contributors: Joshua Whitley, Shichao XIE, xiesc

1.5.1 (2018-12-10)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#194 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/194>`_ from ros-drivers/avoid_unnecessary_computation
  Avoid unnecessary computation - causes approximately 20% performance increase on VLP-32C - should be similar for other sensors
* std::vector<>::reserve is your friend
* add static to avoid frequence memory allocation
* avoid unecesary calculations in unpack()
* Contributors: Davide Faconti, Joshua Whitley

1.5.0 (2018-10-19)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#164 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/164>`_ from ros-drivers/maint/vlp_32c_support
  Adding VLP-32C support.
  This was tested by AutonomouStuff and several external users. Though it does not include new information that I've learned (it appears that the distance resolution is different <50m vs >=50m), it is a good start.
* Merge pull request `#189 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/189>`_ from kveretennicov/patch-1
* Fix malformed plugin description XML
  ROS pluginlib only recognizes multiple <library> elements if they are under
  <class_libraries> XML root. It silently ignores malformed XMLs with multiple
  <library> "root"s and just reads the first one, due to relaxed way tinyxml2 does
  parsing. Though if you do `rosrun nodelet declared_nodelets`, the issue is
  reported properly.
  See also similar issue in https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/issues/131
* Adding distance_resolution to test yaml files.
* Adding VLP-32C support.
  Based on work done by @rockcdr. Adds distance_resolution calibration
  value to support 0.004m distance resolution for VLP-32C.
* Contributors: Joshua Whitley, Konstantin Veretennicov

1.4.0 (2018-09-19)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#178 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/178>`_ from sts-thm/bugfix_issue\_`#174 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/174>`_
  Bugfix issue `#174 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/174>`_
* Merge pull request `#177 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/177>`_ from C-NR/feature/WrapPointcloudData
  Feature/wrap pointcloud data
* Changes fixing deadlock for specific cut_angle values.
* moved definition of VPoint and VPointCloud back to namespace rawdata in rawdata.h
* put a wrapper around pointcloud data including a generic setter method to enable the use of arbitrary data structures  (pcl pointcloud, depth image, octomaps and so on) to be filled by just using RawData::unpack method with the wrapper object as parameter
* Merge pull request `#170 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/170>`_ from ros-drivers/maint/move_header_files
  Moving header files to traditional location inside include folders.
* Merge pull request `#160 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/160>`_ from ros-drivers/maint/updating_package_xml_to_v2
* Updated all package.xmls to ver 2. Cleaned up catkin_lint errors.
  All package.xml files are now compatible with version 2 of the
  package.xml specification in REP 140. Removed some unnecessary
  execute permissions on a few files. Fixed a missing test_depend.
* Merge pull request `#136 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/136>`_ from stsundermann/patch-1
  Use std::abs instead of abs
* Adding missing 32C configuration file.
* Merge pull request `#139 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/139>`_ from ASDeveloper00/vlp32
  Adding support for VLP-32C.
* Merge pull request `#138 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/138>`_ from volkandre/cut_at_specified_angle_feature
  Cut at specified angle feature

1.3.0 (2017-11-10)

  Added an interface to set up raw data processing offline
* Added an interface to set up raw data processing from a locally defined calibration file. This method is useful when processing data offline from a bag file, without starting any ros master

  DISTANCE_MAX and DISTANCE_MAX_UNITS are not used anywhere in the code.

* Modified velodyne_point_cloud/src/lib/rawdata.cc to address warning
  that last_azimuth_diff variable may be used uninitialized.  Variable
  is now initialized to 0 at creation.
  velodyne/velodyne_pointcloud/src/lib/rawdata.cc:328:57: error: âlast_azimuth_diffâ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
  azimuth_corrected_f = azimuth + (azimuth_diff * ((dsr*VLP16_DSR_TOFFSET) + (firing*VLP16_FIRING_TOFFSET)) / VLP16_BLOCK_TDURATION);
* Modified  velodyne_pointcloud/src/conversion/colors.cc to remove
  address build warning for strict-aliasing.
  velodyne/velodyne_pointcloud/src/conversions/colors.cc:84:58:

* velodyne_pointcloud: use recommended add_dependencies() CMake variable `#78 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/78>`_
* velodyne_pointcloud: fix transform unit tests
  Use tf2_ros static_transform_publisher for more consistent timing (`#2 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/2>`_)
* Merge branch reconfigure_transform_node of https://github.com/fudger/velodyne
* prepare change history for coming Indigo release (`#59 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/59>`_)
* calibration: unit test case improvements (`#84 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/84>`_)
* calibration: read all intensities as float, then convert (`#84 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/84>`_)
* calibration: add gtest for `#84 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/84>`_
  This currently fails on 64e_s2.1-sztaki.yaml and on issue_84_float_intensities.yaml.
* calibration: make max_intensity and min_intensity optional (`#84 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/84>`_)
  This fixes a regression in the 32e and VLP-16 calibrations which do not contain
  intensity values. There is still a problem with the 64e_s2.1 calibration.
* Merge pull request `#76 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/76>`_ from pomerlef/master
  Sign inversion in some equations
* Merge pull request `#82 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/82>`_ from ros-drivers/fix_pr_80
  Fix pr 80; adding travis CI tests.
* fix the yaml-cpp 0.5 code paths
* Merge pull request `#80 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/80>`_ from ros-drivers/fix_yaml_import
  allow floats in min/max_intensity and make horiz_offset_correction optional
* allow horiz_offset_correction to be optional with 0 as default
* allow floats instead of ints in min/max_intensity
* Resolve frame ID name using tf prefix.
* Improve coding style.
* Set up dynamic reconfiguration for transform_node.
  Previously, transform_node has neither read parameters other than frame_id from the command line nor has it exposed these parameters via dynamic reconfigure. As parameters like max_range and view_width have been initialized to zero, the inconfigurable transform_node has returned an empty point cloud.
  Now, transform_node launches an reconfigure server just as cloud_node. In contrast to cloud_node, transform node exposes another parameter for dynamic reconfiguration: frame_id, i.e. the frame of reference the incoming Velodyne points are transformed to.
* Merge pull request `#77 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/77>`_ from fudger/pretty_print
  Fix output of calibration data onto console

  for (int dsr=0; ...
* VLP-16: skip badly formatted data packets (`#62 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/62>`_, `#63 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/63>`_)
* restore VLP-16 min_range setting to 0.4 (`#60 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/60>`_)
  NOTE: There is still some other problem keeping that from working.
* permit min_range settings below 0.9 meters (`#60 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/60>`_)
  No known models are currently known to return closer measurements.
* Merge pull request `#55 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/55>`_ from lemiant/azimuth_bug_VLP16
  Fixed azimuth overflow bug.
* Fixed azimuth overflow bug.
  For interpolated azimuth values between 35999.5 and 36000.0 the nested round(fmod())
  yields a value of 36000 which is invalid and overflows the pre-computed sin/cos arrays,
  since they only go form 0..35999
