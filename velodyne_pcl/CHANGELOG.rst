* remove velodyne_pcl from velodyne stack trunk
* make INFO message on every pointcloud a DEBUG message
* finished reorganization + splitting up of the nodes + changed velodyne/pcl_points2 topic name to velodyne/pointcloud
* reorganized the package, and renamed ExamplePublisher to Publisher
* run transform2 nodelet
* fixed issues in nodelets, equated nodes to match nodelets - there was some issue with using KdTree in the nodelet that I did not have time to debug - so it has been removed
* created example nodelets for the corresponding nodes
* some pretty printing + fixed subscriber to do euclidean cluster extraction using PCL
* fixed bugs in example code
* added a couple of examples using the pcl_ros bridge
* add waitForTransform() before transforming point cloud packet
* change convertPoints() to use PointCloud2ConstPtr for input
* add nodelet to assign colors to laser rings for visualization
* remove redundant typedefs
* add transform2 nodelet unit test
* add PCL transform to transform2 nodelet
* check in omitted nodelets.xml update
* create initial transform2 nodelet from cloud2 nodelet
* nodelet test now works, remove "broken" label
* set svn:keywords props to Id
* publish PointCloud2 for each scan in nodelet
* Prepare cloud2 nodelet for accumulating data for a whole scan (incomplete).
  Add Velodyne::xyz_scans_t typedef.
* set Id property on test files
* add simple unit tests of node and nodelet publication
  rates -- nodelet currently fails the test
* remove cerr printing, nodelet now runs
* fixed nodelets.xml so that nodelet is correctly visible
* use new point_types header in nodelet, too
* Add exported header file for custom Velodyne point types.
  Use new velodyne::PointXYZIR custom point type in cloud2 node.
  Print std::cerr message when nodelet methods entered (nothing shows).
* fixed issue with custom pcl point type in cloud2_nodelet
* library path correction
* small nodelet improvements
* Make Velodyne:: namespace references explicit.
  Accumulate data using PointCloud<PointXYZI> instead of PointCloud2.
  Delete some unnecessary cruft.
* comment out enough so nodelet will at least compile
* add nodelets.xml export
* experimental stack for PCL output
